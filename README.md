This is a repository containing the implementation of prospective scenarios 
for France into ecoinvent. The prospective scenarios are provided in the 
"Futurs énergétiques 2050" (also called "Energy pathways to 2050") study by 
the French Transmission System Operator - RTE. The scope of RTE prospective 
study is metropolitan France, from now to 2050, and covers in details the 
electricity mix sector and with less details the fuel & gas, and hydrogen 
sectors. This repository creates market-specific activities in the LCA database ecoinvent for the following sectors in France:
* electricity
* hydrogen
* fuel & gas

The evolution at the world regional scale are modeled by coupling the 
French scenarios with a global scenario provided by an Integrated 
Assessment Model (IAM).

The figure below shows the different electricity and liquid fuel markets created in the ecoinvent database.

RTE prospective study 
------------------------

Prospective scenarios are extracted from the study : Futurs énergétiques 2050, RTE, 2021-2022\
[`Website`](https://www.rte-france.com/analyses-tendances-et-prospectives/bilan-previsionnel-2050-futurs-energetiques) \
[`Reports`](https://www.rte-france.com/analyses-tendances-et-prospectives/bilan-previsionnel-2050-futurs-energetiques#Lesdocuments) \
[`Data repository`](https://www.rte-france.com/analyses-tendances-et-prospectives/bilan-previsionnel-2050-futurs-energetiques#Lesdonnees)


RTE provides 3 demand scenarios : 
* reference
* extensive reindustrialisation (higher demand compared to reference scenario)
* sobriety (lower demand compared to reference scenario).

For each demand scenario, RTE provides 6 electricity production scenarios 
* M0, M1, M23 : that rely mostly on renewables development
* N1, N2, N03 : that rely both on renewables and nuclear development

It makes a total of 3 * 6 = 18 scenarios. 


How is the repository organized ?
-----------

This repository is meant to be used with the open-source python library [`premise`](https://github.com/polca/premise), using the [`user-defined scenario functionnality`](https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_scenarios.html).
The data relating to the annual production volumes of different energy carriers 
(e.g. electricity, hydrogen) for each scenario 
have been formatted and organised in a data package defined by the Frictionless standards 
(Walsh and Pollock, 2022). This data package is read and interpreted by `premise`. 
We therefore store a number of scenarios in a single data package.

This datapackage contains four files necessary to the scenarios implementation into the ecoinvent LCA database: 

* A **datapackage.json** file, which provides the metadata for the data package (e.g. authors, scenario descriptions, list and locations of resources, etc.). 
* A **config.yaml** file which provides the correspondence between the scenario variables and the LCA datasets in the ecoinvent DB, as well as the additional "LCA datasets" when they are not available in the ecoinvent database. 
* A tabular data **scenario_data.csv** file containing the time series for each variable in the set of scenarios. 
* An optional Excel file **LCI-FE2050.xlsx** containing the LCA inventories of the additional "LCA datasets" for any technology not initially present in the ecoinvent database. 

Additionally, a pdf document called "supplementary information" presents the methodological choices that where made to build this model.


How to use this repository ?
------------------
### 0. Prerequisites: ecoinvent licence for ecoinvent 3.10.1 or 3.11 or 3.12
     
### 1. Install the environment : **premise version => 2.4.7**
The authors tested the version of premise compatible with brightway2 but not the one compatible with brightway 2.5.

* Install the environmentas explained [`here`](https://github.com/polca/premise?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-install-this-package).
```bash
pip install "premise[bw2]"==2.4.7
```

* *OR* install the environment with requirements.txt file
```bash
conda create -n premise247 python==3.11
conda activate premise247
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Create a brightway project and load ecoinvent 3.10.1 database in the project. 
It can be done using [`ecoinvent_interface`](https://github.com/brightway-lca/ecoinvent_interface) or running the notebook load_ecoinvent after adding ecoinvent username, password and version. 

### 3. Generate prospective databases for some chosen combinations of Year x IAM model x IAM scenario x French scenario.
A prospective version of ecoinvent is generated for each combination of : Year x IAM model x IAM scenario x French scenario.\
The newly created market datasets are tagged with 'FE2050', for example : `market for electricity, high voltage, FE2050` (FR)

* Run the file **run-premise-rte.md** provided in this repository (add premise key before!)
* *OR* **Run the following script** (add premise key before!). It is an example for two French scenarios combined with the same IAM scenario.
premise key can be asked to Romain Sacchi.

  ```python

    import brightway2 as bw
    from premise import *
    import bw2data
    import bw2io
    from datapackage import Package

    NAME_BW_PROJECT="name_of_my_project"
    eco_version="3.12"
    ecoinvent_db_name='ecoinvent-3.12-cutoff'
    ecoinvent_bio_db_name="ecoinvent-3.12-biosphere"
  
    #Open the brightway project
    bw2data.projects.set_current(NAME_BW_PROJECT)
    
    fp = r"datapackage-ei-312.json"
    rte = Package(fp)

    #Choose the IAM model
    model_1="tiam-ucl"
    #Choose the world scenario
    world_scenario_1="SSP2-RCP45"
    #Choose the Year
    year=2050
    #Choose the French scenario 
    fr_scenario_1="Reference - M0"
    fr_scenario_4="Reference - N03"
    
    scenarios = [
        {"model": model_1, "pathway":world_scenario_1, "year": year, "external scenarios": [{"scenario": fr_scenario_1, "data": rte}]},
        {"model": model_1, "pathway":world_scenario_1, "year": year, "external scenarios": [{"scenario": fr_scenario_4, "data": rte}]},
        ]
  
    ndb = NewDatabase(
        scenarios = scenarios,        
        source_db=ecoinvent_db_name,
        source_version=eco_version,
        key="" , #ask the key to Romain Sacchi
        biosphere_name=ecoinvent_db_name,
        )
  
    ndb.update()
  
    ndb.write_db_to_brightway()
  
    list(bw2data.databases)

  ```

### ⚠️ WARNINGS ⚠️ 
* ⚠️The modeled markets for hydrogen do not cover all uses of hydrogen, only material uses of hydrogen for the following industrial sectors : ammonia, steel, chemistry, diverse sectors, refinery). This model does not cover energetic, grid balancing and synthetic fuel uses of hydrogen.
* ⚠️ The proxy used to generate imports and exports electricity datasets probably artificially overestimates the imports in 2060. The electricity datasets for 2060 shall be used with caution.
* ⚠️ By default, the electricity imports to French markets are modeled with the prospective European electricity production mix. As the European electricity mix impacts vary a lot from one IAM scenario to another , the French electricity impacts is highly dependent on the IAM scenarios selected.

IAM scenario compatibility
---------------------------

The user can couple each French scenario with a global scenario (IAM) provided by premise. The available IAM scenarios provided by premise can be explored [`here`](https://premisedash-6f5a0259c487.herokuapp.com/).\
The choice of IAM scenario is under the responsability of the user of this repository. However, the authors highlight the facts that : 
* all the French scenarios modeled target French carbon neutrality in 2050 (at territorial scale, not footprint).*
* RTE mentions in its report that the electricity scenarios have been tested under RCP 4.5 climatic conditions (i.e. production and consumpption patterns take into account climate evolutions following RCP4.5 trajectory) 
* the absolute impacts of French prospective energy markets highly depends on the IAM scenario chosen. 

The authors also strongly advice :
* to read [`premise documentation on how to choose IAM scenarios`](https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#choosing-the-right-iam)
* to read 'Recommendations for an informed and responsible use of Integrated Assessment Models in prospective LCA', ([`Paris et al., 2026`](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11367-026-02659-4))
* to keep in mind the key limitations of using IAMs presented in ([`de Bortoli et al., 2025`](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2025.115924)) and in premise documentation  [`here`](https://github.com/polca/premise#disclaimer-on-the-use-of-iam-based-scenarios-in-premise)
